     <h2>Corporate Relocation Services</h2>
     <p>JB Transit understands that your company’s relocation needs are unique. We can help your company develop a corporate relocation plan that fits your organization’s needs without compromising service or quality, regardless of your company’s size.</p>
     <p>If you are an employee relocating with a lump sum, JB can help streamline your corporate move so you can concentrate on your new assignment. From helping you with packing and storage to finding realtors with our CityPointe&reg; Real Estate Rewards program, we can eliminate some of the stressful tasks that come with a corporate relocation.</p>
     <p>If you are a corporate relocation manager, JB can act as a seamless extension of your relocation team, providing necessary administrative tasks and move management, allowing you to focus on other important aspects of your job. Our goal is to help your employees arrive at their destinations on time and within budget so they can settle into their new role sooner. If your transferee has a smaller move, see all of the benefits of our small move program Snapmoves here.</p>

    <h2>Corporate Packing Services</h2>
    <p>JB offers professional full packing services that can save time and alleviate stress. Your corporate relocation can be demanding; let JB do the heavy lifting. Our partial packing services allow you to select which items/rooms you may need more assistance with and which ones you would like to pack yourself. JB can help you get organized with our unpacking services. We can unpack the boxes we packed for you, allowing you to focus on more important things like settling into your new home and job. Let us know at the time we provide your quote– or, if you decide later, any time before we complete your delivery – and we’ll return within 30 days after delivery to pick up your empty cartons and packing-related materials waste. In addition to the above, we offer custom crating for specialty/fragile items, electronics packing and installation services</P>
    
    <h2>Storage Options for Corporate Movers</h2>
    <P>United Van Lines is fully equipped to handle many of your corporate moving-related storage needs with our short-term and long-term storage services. Are you a corporate relocation manager looking for comprehensive moving and storage solutions? United understands that some moves take a little extra time. Our storage-in-transit services are designed to help your employees as they finalize their move-in dates and plans. If you are an employee planning a corporate relocation and you’re still looking for your new home, or it will not be ready when you arrive, we can help with storage services.</P>
    
    <h2>Corporate Relocation Protection Packages</h2>
    <P>Protecting you when unexpected loss or damage to your belongings occurs during your move is important to us; that is why we offer our basic Full Value Protection plan to every corporate relocation manager as part of our basic corporate relocation package. Unless your employer has made other arrangements with United, your moving quote will include our basic Full Value Protection option, which is plenty for most long-distance household moves. Under this option, should damage or loss occur during your United move, your personal belongings will be repaired or replaced, or United may offer you other compensation up to the total amount of the shipment protection that you select. Important terms and conditions apply, so be sure to ask your United move coordinator for more details about the option selected by your company.</P>
